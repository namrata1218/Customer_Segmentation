# Customer Segmentation ML Project

Introduction: Customer segmentation is a vital strategy for businesses aiming to understand their customer base and tailor their marketing efforts effectively. This machine learning project focuses on segmenting customers into distinct groups based on various attributes such as demographics, purchasing behavior, and engagement metrics. By segmenting customers, businesses can personalize their marketing campaigns, optimize product offerings, and improve customer satisfaction.

Objective: The primary objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model for customer segmentation. Specifically, we aim to:

Utilize clustering techniques to group similar customers together. Identify meaningful segments based on customer attributes. Provide actionable insights and recommendations for marketing strategies and product development.

Approach:

Data Preprocessing: Cleanse the dataset by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Gain insights into the distribution and characteristics of the customer data through visualizations and statistical analysis. Feature Engineering: Extract relevant features or transform existing features to enhance the segmentation process. Model Development: Implement clustering algorithms such as K-means, hierarchical clustering, or DBSCAN to segment customers into distinct groups. Model Evaluation: Assess the quality of the segmentation using metrics such as silhouette score, Davies-Bouldin index, or visual inspection of cluster distributions. Interpretation and Insights: Analyze the characteristics of each customer segment to derive actionable insights and recommendations. Dependencies:
